Repository for the activities of the EDU-CIAA-NXP Course without RTOS given within the framework of the FI-UNER Master of Biomedical Engineering.

All folders that begin with a number are those that are developed during the course. 
They are a very good example of how to program HW layers for driver implementation to use EDU-CIAA-NXP peripherals.
